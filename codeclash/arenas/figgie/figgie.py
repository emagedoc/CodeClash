    description: str = """Figgie is a card trading game invented at Jane Street in 2013.
It simulates open-outcry commodities trading where players buy and sell cards to accumulate the goal suit.

Game Rules:
- 4 or 5 players, each starting with $350
- 4 players: $50 ante, 10 cards each
- 5 players: $40 ante, 8 cards each
- Pot is always $200
- Deck: one 12-card suit, two 10-card suits, one 8-card suit
- Goal suit: same color as 12-card suit, contains 8 or 10 cards
- At end: $10 per goal suit card, remainder to player(s) with most goal suit cards

Trading Model (Simultaneous Tick):
- Each tick, ALL players are polled for their action
- Actions are executed in random order (simulates racing to the order book)
- Order books cleared after each trade (per official Figgie rules)

Your bot (main.py) must implement:

    def get_action(state: dict) -> dict

state contains:
- position: your player index (0-3 or 0-4)
- hand: dict of suit -> count of cards you hold
- money: your current money
- books: dict of suit -> {bid: {price, player} or None, ask: {price, player} or None, last_trade}
- trades: list of completed trades
- num_players: number of players (4 or 5)
- tick: current tick number

Return one of:
- {"type": "pass"}
- {"type": "bid", "suit": "spades", "price": 5}
- {"type": "ask", "suit": "spades", "price": 10}
- {"type": "buy", "suit": "spades"}
- {"type": "sell", "suit": "spades"}

Suits: "spades", "clubs", "hearts", "diamonds"
